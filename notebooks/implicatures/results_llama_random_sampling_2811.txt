 Predict whether Speaker 2's answer to Speaker 1 counts as a yes or as a no
Some useful hints are: <s>[INST] This is a task to Predict whether Speaker 2's answer to Speaker 1 counts as a yes or as a no. We have some expected input and output pairs and have asked labeler to give reason or hint for each expected output. Given following data each contains input, output and reason for the expected output, summarize a general reason for all these cases:
Given input: Speaker 1: 'Did she look pretty?' Speaker 2: 'She was as cute as a kitten.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer is an affirmation, albeit an indirect one. The phrase "cute as a kitten" is a metaphorical expression that implies the person in question has a charming and endearing appearance, which aligns with the idea of looking pretty. The use of the word "cute" also conveys a positive sentiment, further supporting the idea that Speaker 2's answer should be interpreted as a yes.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'You want to do this to the whole world?' Speaker 2: 'So the whole world will be exactly how I want.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer indicates their desire to control the whole world, which aligns with the sentiment of Speaker 1's question. Speaker 2's response suggests a positive answer to the question, "Do you want to do this to the whole world?"

Given input: Speaker 1: 'Are you sending them an invitation?' Speaker 2: 'Certainly.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer, "Certainly," is an affirmative response to Speaker 1's question, indicating that they will indeed send an invitation.

Also do not mention the number of examples nor give any reference to entities in examples in the summary directly or indirectly. Be as general as possible. The summarised reasons are: [/INST]  The reasons for the expected outputs in the given examples can be summarized as follows:

* Indirect affirmation: In some cases, the answer may not be a direct yes, but it still conveys a positive sentiment or implies agreement. This can be seen in cases where a metaphorical expression or a hypothetical scenario is used to convey a positive idea.
* Desire or intention: In other cases, the answer may indicate the person's desire or intention to perform the action suggested in the question. This can be seen in cases where the answer expresses a goal or objective that aligns with the question.
* Direct affirmation: In some cases, the answer may be a direct yes, indicating agreement or confirmation of the question. This can be seen in cases where the answer is a simple "yes" or "certainly."

In general, the reasons for the expected outputs in these examples suggest that the model should be able to recognize and interpret various ways in which a person might express agreement or confirmation, including indirect or hypothetical expressions, as well as direct affirmations.

 Iteration 1 
 Predict whether Speaker 2's answer to Speaker 1 counts as a yes or as a no
Some useful hints are: <s>[INST] This is a task to Predict whether Speaker 2's answer to Speaker 1 counts as a yes or as a no. We have some expected input and output pairs and have asked labeler to give reason or hint for each expected output. Given following data each contains input, output and reason for the expected output, summarize a general reason for all these cases:
Given input: Speaker 1: 'Remember when we use to have fun?' Speaker 2: 'Before you go boring.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer is a playful and lighthearted response that acknowledges the past fun times mentioned by Speaker 1. The use of the word "before" implies a sense of continuity and shared experience, and the phrase "you go boring" is a teasing and humorous way of expressing that Speaker 2 still finds Speaker 1's company enjoyable. Overall, the tone of the exchange is positive and suggestive of a friendly relationship, which supports the interpretation of Speaker 2's answer as a "yes".

Given input: Speaker 1: 'Should I clean this up?' Speaker 2: 'Don't expect me to act as your maid.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer implies that they are not willing to help Speaker 1 clean up, which means that Speaker 1 will have to do it themselves. This can be interpreted as a "yes" answer to the question of whether Speaker 1 should clean it up.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'You stole that doll, didn't you?' Speaker 2: 'Well, i-it looked just like you.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer is evasive and indirectly confirms the accusation. By saying "it looked just like you," Speaker 2 is implying that they did steal the doll, but are trying to avoid directly admitting it. This type of response is often used when someone is trying to avoid taking responsibility for their actions or is trying to downplay the severity of the situation. In this case, it suggests that Speaker 2 is guilty of stealing the doll and is trying to deflect the accusation.

And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer implies that their parents will indeed be angry when they find out about something. The phrase "My parents are going to kill me when they find out" suggests that Speaker 2 believes their parents will have a strong negative reaction, which aligns with the definition of "yes" in this context.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'You invented fire?' Speaker 2: 'I told you that.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer, "I told you that," can be interpreted as a confirmation or validation of Speaker 1's statement.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'Are you going to quit?' Speaker 2: 'Enough is enough.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer, "Enough is enough," implies a sense of finality and frustration, suggesting that they have had enough of whatever it is that Speaker 1 is asking about and are ready to move on or quit. The phrase "enough is enough" is often used to indicate a point of no return, where one is ready to take a stand and make a change, which in this case, could mean quitting. Additionally, the tone of the answer is assertive and decisive, which further suggests that Speaker 2 is leaning towards quitting.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'Do you feel comfortable here?' Speaker 2: 'From day one.'

We have some expected input and output pairs and have asked labeler to give reason or hint for each expected output. Given following data each contains input, output and reason for the expected output, summarize a general reason for all these cases:
Given input: Speaker 1: 'Do they fight?' Speaker 2: 'They fight like cats and dogs.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer uses the idiomatic expression "fight like cats and dogs," which is a common way of saying that two entities are constantly arguing or fighting. The phrase is often used to describe a heated rivalry or competition between two parties, and in this context, it suggests that the two entities in question (whatever they may be) are engaged in a fierce conflict. Therefore, Speaker 2's answer can be interpreted as a "yes" in response to Speaker 1's question about whether they fight.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'Do you have any ketchup left?' Speaker 2: 'We are swimming in it.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer, "We are swimming in it," is an idiomatic expression that means they have an abundance of ketchup, far more than they need. The phrase "swimming in it" is a metaphorical expression that implies an excessive amount of ketchup, rather than a literal lack of it. Therefore, Speaker 2's answer can be interpreted as a yes, indicating that they do have ketchup left.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'Does anyone know how to pick a lock?' Speaker 2: 'Sure. Picking locks is my thing.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer indicates that they have the ability to pick locks, which implies that they know how to do it. The phrase "picking locks is my thing" suggests that it is something they are skilled at or have experience with, which further supports the idea that they know how to pick locks.

We have some expected input and output pairs and have asked labeler to give reason or hint for each expected output. Given following data each contains input, output and reason for the expected output, summarize a general reason for all these cases:
Given input: Speaker 1: 'Is he naughty?' Speaker 2: 'Boys will be boys.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer, "Boys will be boys," can be interpreted as a way of saying that the person in question (the "he" referred to in Speaker 1's question) is indeed naughty. The phrase "boys will be boys" is often used to excuse or justify boys' or men's mischievous or disruptive behavior, implying that it is a natural or expected part of being male. Therefore, Speaker 2's answer can be seen as a tacit agreement with Speaker 1's suggestion that the person in question is naughty.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'You took my photo off the ofrenda?!' Speaker 2: 'It was an accident!'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer does not directly address the question asked by Speaker 1. Speaker 1 asked if Speaker 2 took their photo off the ofrenda, and Speaker 2 responded by saying it was an accident. This implies that Speaker 2 did indeed take the photo off the ofrenda, but is trying to downplay their actions by saying it was unintentional. Therefore, Speaker 2's answer can be interpreted as a yes, as they did perform the action mentioned in the question, even if they didn't mean to.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'Did you order the code red?' Speaker 2: 'You're goddamn right.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer, "You're goddamn right," is an affirmative response to Speaker 1's question, "Did you order the code red?" The use of the phrase "goddamn right" emphasizes the affirmation, indicating that Speaker 2 is confidently confirming that they did, in fact, order the code red.

* Speaker 2's answer is an affirmative response to Speaker 1's question, with an emphasis that indicates confidence in their action.

In general, the reasons for the expected outputs suggest that Speaker 2's answers, while not always directly addressing the question, can still be interpreted as a yes due to their implied meaning or emphasis.

Given following data each contains input, output and reason for the expected output, summarize a general reason for all these cases:
Given input: Speaker 1: 'You took my photo off the ofrenda?!' Speaker 2: 'It was an accident!'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer does not directly address the question asked by Speaker 1. Speaker 1 asked if Speaker 2 took their photo off the ofrenda, and Speaker 2 responded by saying it was an accident. This implies that Speaker 2 did indeed take the photo off the ofrenda, but is trying to downplay their actions by saying it was unintentional. Therefore, Speaker 2's answer can be interpreted as a yes, as they did perform the action mentioned in the question, even if they didn't mean to.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'Are you going to talk to Mark?' Speaker 2: 'I have a bone to pick with Mark.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer indicates that they have a problem or issue to discuss with Mark, which means they are likely to talk to him. The phrase "bone to pick" is a common idiom that implies a disagreement or issue that needs to be addressed, and it suggests that Speaker 2 is willing to engage in a conversation with Mark to resolve the issue.

Given input: Speaker 1: 'Do you know how to get there?' Speaker 2: 'It's right around the corner.'
And its expected output: yes. And the reason for the expected output: The expected output is "yes" because Speaker 2's answer, "It's right around the corner," implies that they do know how to get there. The phrase "right around the corner" suggests that the destination is nearby and easily accessible, which means that Speaker 2 has the necessary information to guide Speaker 1 to the destination. Therefore, Speaker 2's answer can be considered a "yes" in response to Speaker 1's question.

* The answer may indicate a problem or issue that needs to be addressed, which implies a willingness to engage in a conversation or take action.
* The answer may provide information that suggests the person knows how to get to the destination, even if it's not a direct answer to the question.

In general, the reasons for the expected outputs suggest that the model should look beyond the literal meaning of the answer and consider the implied meaning, context, and potential idioms or phrases that may be used to convey a different message.
